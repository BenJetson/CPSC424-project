# CPSC 424 Spring 2020 Project

Your project is worth 100 points.

The goal of the project is to further develop understanding of the course
material, which is centered around system administration and security.
Therefore, your project should explore topics related to security. Projects are
done in groups of up to 4 students. If a group has a graduate student, then that
graduate student will need to provide an extension to the project – develop an
additional functionality of some kind. This extension will be graded as a
graduate student requirement and will not affect the grade of the undergraduate
teammates.

Students will need to conduct research into similar projects and motivate why
their project is important. This project should become a well-documented open
source project that others in the Linux community can use. It is recommended
that the project is housed on github, but it is not required. Project can be
based on other open source projects. Your tool can be a command-line tool, or
use a visual interface developed in a visual language of your choice. The
general topic areas are listed below:

- Develop an open source tool that detects intrusion to the system, suspends the
  attack, and secures the system.
- Develop a visual or command-line tool to penetrate a system (this should be
  geared towards the latest Linux distributions).
- Develop an open-source system administration tool that assists with system
  monitoring/security tasks.
- Develop a tool to collect and process data from IoT.

All topics are subject to approval! Project will be done in milestones.

## Milestone 1 Due: 3/14 before 11:59 pm (10%)

Write a 1-page project proposal in .pdf format. Clearly identify the objectives
of your project. Describe in detail what you are doing and why you are doing it.
Show related research/projects. Explain why your project is important. List
members of your group (no more than 4), and describe the system/s that you are
using for your project. Your project should either use a VM, or any Linux
installation of your choice, not Windows. Submit to canvas to get feedback.

## Milestone 2 Due 3/24 before 11:59 pm (10%)

Show that you have made a significant progress on your project. Show working
code, print and submit research papers that back your project, etc. Explain how
you are testing the existing parts. This should be a rough draft with already
working modules. You will submit a 1-page description of what you have
implemented and what you are planning to add to the existing project, plus no
less than 3 or more research papers that back it up.

## Milestone 3 Due: 4/6 and 4/8 in class and submit via canvas before 4/8 before 11:59 pm (30%)

Because we are meeting on Zoom, you will present your project on Zoom. Your
presentation will be no longer than 15 minutes, and no shorter than 8 minutes.
It should have audio and video and demo all parts of your project. Provide
motivation why you have done what you have done, and why it is
important/cool/etc.

## Final paper submission Due: 4/9 before 11;59 pm via canvas (50%)

You will submit a 2 – 2.5 page paper that describes the details of your project.
The paper should be written in ACM format. Please keep in mind that this format
is a lot tighter than the regular double-spaced APA or MLA format. The paper
should be detailed enough so that those who are not familiar with your work
could understand all the details of it. The narrative has to be accompanied by
(a reasonable number of) data tables and/or figures. You need to show exactly
how the project works and what does not work. Indicate what improvements you
would do in the future. Your paper should have several components:

- Abstract: please remember that an abstract has a very simple goal – to let
  potential readers know what the paper is about. Readers often look through the
  abstracts to determine if a paper is within their research interest. You are
  not motivating the subject matter here or explaining why you have chosen the
  particular topic.
- Introduction: introduce your topic, summarize what you did, why you did it and
  your results.
- Background: include the background that is appropriate for your project.
  Include material from your research, but only the information that is directly
  relevant to your project. You should find several external sources of
  information that provide you guidance for your work.
- Motivations and objectives: explain what you are trying to do and why you are
  doing it. Position your project with respect to the related work you
  identified in the background section.
- Methodology/Design: explain the methods and/or system design that you used to
  achieve your objectives. You should have at least one figure that illustrates
  the methodology or design.
- Graduate students: User's Manual. For the projects that are building something
  that is meant to be used by 'users', this section should allow a user to
  understand how to use the system. This fully documents what you have built. If
  there are systems that you use, such as MySQL or PHP packages, you should
  provide detailed instructions as to how someone should install these
  components. The instructions should provide enough details so that one of your
  classmates can get your project running on his/her VM given your tar.gz and
  final report.
- Analysis/results: This documents the validation, demonstration, analysis of
  your project.
- Conclusions and future work: Summarize what you achieved and draw conclusions
  on your work. Identify weaknesses in what you have done. Describe any future
  work that you think needs to be performed.
